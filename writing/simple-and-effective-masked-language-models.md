# Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLM)

## Problem Motivation: Bridging Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models

### The Performance Gap Challenge

**Autoregressive (AR) models** achieve state-of-the-art perplexities but suffer from:
- **Strictly sequential sampling**: Each token depends on all previous tokens
- **No parallel generation**: Cannot generate multiple tokens simultaneously
- **Limited controllability**: Difficult to modify generation mid-sequence

**Discrete diffusion models** promise:
- **Parallel generation**: Multiple tokens can be generated simultaneously
- **Controllable generation**: Can modify specific parts of sequences
- **Variable-length output**: Flexible sequence lengths

**Historical gap**: Discrete diffusion LMs underperform AR baselines by **25-50%** in log-likelihood.

**MDLM contribution**: Closes this gap to within **15-25%** through principled design choices.

## Core Innovation 1: Masking-Based Forward Process

### Traditional Discrete Diffusion (D3PM)

D3PM uses a categorical Markov forward process:

$$
q(z_t|x) = \text{Cat}(z_t; \bar{Q}_t x)
$$

$$
\bar{Q}_t = Q_t Q_{t-1} \cdots Q_1
$$

where $Q_t$ are transition matrices between vocabulary states.

### MDLM's Masking Process

**Key insight**: Use a single absorbing **[MASK]** state $m$ instead of complex transition matrices.

**Continuous-time forward process**:

$$
q(z_t|x) = \text{Cat}(z_t; \alpha_t x + (1-\alpha_t) m)
$$

where:
- $t \in [0,1]$ is continuous time
- $\alpha_0 \approx 1 \to \alpha_1 \approx 0$ controls progressive masking
- $\alpha_t$ is a monotonically decreasing noise schedule

**Intuition**: 
- At $t=0$: Nearly all original tokens preserved ($\alpha_0 \approx 1$)
- At $t=1$: Nearly all tokens masked ($\alpha_1 \approx 0$)
- Intermediate times: Gradual transition from original to fully masked

## Core Innovation 2: SUBS (Substitution) Parameterization

### The Challenge with Standard Parameterizations

Standard diffusion models predict noise or original data directly, leading to:
- **Computational inefficiency**: Must evaluate all vocabulary positions
- **Numerical instability**: Softmax over large vocabularies
- **Poor sample quality**: Indirect relationship to target tokens

### SUBS Parameterization Design

**Neural denoiser**: $x_\theta(z_t, t) \in \Delta^V$ (probability simplex over vocabulary)

**Two key constraints**:

1. **Zero Masking**: 
   
   $$
   \langle x_\theta(z_t, t), m \rangle = 0
   $$
   
   The model assigns zero probability to the mask token (equivalently, mask logit $\to -\infty$).

2. **Carry-Over**: 
   
   $$
   \text{if } z_t \neq m, \text{ then } x_\theta(z_t, t) = z_t
   $$
   
   Unmasked tokens are predicted with probability 1 (no uncertainty).

### Exact Posterior Derivation

These constraints yield the **exact posterior**:

$$
q(z_s|z_t, x) = \begin{cases}
\text{Cat}(z_s; z_t), & z_t \neq m \\[6pt]
\text{Cat}\left(z_s; \frac{(1-\alpha_s)m + (\alpha_s - \alpha_t)x}{1-\alpha_t}\right), & z_t = m
\end{cases}
$$

**Interpretation**:
- **Unmasked positions**: No change (deterministic carry-over)
- **Masked positions**: Probability of unmasking proportional to $(\alpha_s - \alpha_t)$

Setting $p_\theta(z_s|z_t, t) = q(z_s|z_t, x_\theta(z_t, t))$ provides a **Rao-Blackwellized** objective with reduced variance.

## Core Innovation 3: Continuous-Time ELBO

### Discrete-Time Foundation

For $T$ discrete timesteps, the diffusion loss becomes:

$$
L_{\text{diffusion}} = \sum_{i=1}^T \mathbb{E}_q\left[\frac{\alpha_{t_i} - \alpha_{s_i}}{1-\alpha_{t_i}} \log\langle x_\theta(z_{t_i}, t_i), x \rangle\right]
$$

**Key properties**:
- **Weighted masked language modeling**: Similar to BERT's MLM objective
- **Zero contribution from unmasked tokens**: Only masked positions contribute to loss
- **Time-dependent weighting**: $\frac{\alpha_{t_i} - \alpha_{s_i}}{1-\alpha_{t_i}}$ balances early vs. late denoising

### Continuous-Time Limit

Taking $T \to \infty$ yields the **continuous-time ELBO**:

$$
L_{\infty\text{-NELBO}} = \mathbb{E}\int_0^1 \frac{\alpha'_t}{1-\alpha_t} \sum_{\ell=1}^L \log\langle x_\theta^\ell(z_{1:L,t}, t), x_\ell \rangle \, dt
$$

**Critical insight**: This objective is **invariant to the specific noise schedule** $\alpha_t$, only depending on the ratio $\frac{\alpha'_t}{1-\alpha_t}$.

**Advantages**:
- **Schedule flexibility**: Can choose $\alpha_t$ for computational efficiency without affecting optimality
- **Continuous formulation**: More principled than discrete approximations
- **Reduced variance**: Continuous integration smoother than discrete summation

## Semi-Autoregressive (SAR) Sampling Strategy

### Efficient Ancestral Sampling

**Observation**: At each timestep, only newly unmasked tokens require network evaluation.

**Caching strategy**:
1. Store $x_\theta(z_t, t)$ predictions
2. Skip network calls when no new tokens unmask
3. Significant speedup over naive re-evaluation

### Semi-Autoregressive Generation

**Problem**: How to generate sequences longer than training length $L$?

**SAR solution**:
1. Generate initial block of length $L$
2. Use last $L'$ tokens as prefix for next generation
3. Generate next $L'$ tokens (overlapping with previous block)
4. Repeat to achieve unbounded sequence length

**Mathematical formulation**:
- Block 1: Generate $x_{1:L}$
- Block 2: Given $x_{L-L'+1:L}$, generate $x_{L+1:L+L'}$
- Block $k$: Given $x_{(k-1)L'-L'+1:(k-1)L'}$, generate $x_{(k-1)L'+1:kL'}$

**Benefits**:
- **Parallel within blocks**: Each block generated in parallel
- **Unbounded length**: No limit on total sequence length
- **Controllable overlap**: $L'$ controls continuity vs. speed tradeoff

## Architecture and Engineering Insights

### Diffusion Transformer (DiT) Design

**Core architecture**:
- **Transformer backbone**: Standard self-attention mechanism
- **Rotary embeddings**: Position encoding for variable-length sequences
- **Time conditioning**: Inject timestep $t$ via learned embeddings
- **Layer normalization**: Stabilize training dynamics

### Critical Engineering Choices

1. **Moderate vocabulary sizes**: 32k tokens (vs. 50k+ in some AR models)
   - **Rationale**: Reduces softmax computational burden
   - **Trade-off**: Slightly longer sequences but faster computation

2. **Masked-only evaluation**: Compute loss only on masked positions
   - **Numerical stability**: Avoid gradient issues from carry-over constraint
   - **Efficiency**: Reduce computation by ~50% during training

3. **Low-discrepancy time sampling**: Correlated time points to reduce ELBO variance
   - **Standard approach**: Random uniform sampling of $t \sim U(0,1)$
   - **MDLM approach**: Quasi-random sequences with better coverage

### Training Objective

**Final training loss**:

$$
L = L_{\text{reconstruction}} + L_{\infty\text{-NELBO}} + L_{\text{prior}}
$$

where:
- $L_{\text{reconstruction}}$: Standard cross-entropy at $t=0$
- $L_{\infty\text{-NELBO}}$: Continuous-time diffusion objective
- $L_{\text{prior}}$: KL divergence to uniform prior at $t=1$
